Design and Compilation:
To compile the program please use gmake sv_node.
To execute the program sv_node b1-n00.out.

sv_node.cpp parses the startup configuration file and creates  userinput ,timer ,server,client threads.
The node depending upon if it is a beacon node or not, sends a connection request to the other beacon nodes from the config file.
Once the connection between two nodes is established , corresponding server, client threads trying to connect to the same nodes are deleted.
Beacon nodes send a hello message to each other and a non-beacon node send a join request message, if it does not get enough responses
it terminates itself. Periodically every keepalivetimeout/2 (i.e 30s) keepalive messages are sent out from every node and on not receiving any 
any message from a particular node untill 60s,it closes its connection to the node.
Userinput thread handles the user commandline interface for status nieghbours.
TempRead thread is used to handle join requests and the condition where a node does not get enough join responses to its requests, it terminates itself.
Each request type, response type, Common Header has its own datastructure in the common.h file.
utilities.h file has functions to do the logging, check the duplicate packets and drop them.
